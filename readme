# Astroarchaeology: A Computational Framework

This repository provides a computational framework for the field of astroarchaeology. The goal is to move beyond qualitative observation and provide a robust, data-driven methodology for verifying the astronomical significance of ancient sites.

By combining modern geographic data with precise astronomical modeling, this project tests the hypothesis that ancient cultures used their surrounding landscape as functional, large-scale solar observatories.

## Core Concept: The Landscape as an Instrument

The central hypothesis explored here is that certain prominent geographical features (such as a pass between two mountains) were not merely symbolic landmarks. Instead, they may have been used as precise natural instruments to frame and mark significant celestial events, such as the sunrise on a solstice or equinox.

This project seeks to empirically validate or refute such claims by calculating whether these alignments are a matter of coincidence or a product of intentional site selection and observation.

## Methodology

The verification process is a two-stage methodology that combines geospatial analysis with historical astronomical calculations.

1.  **Geographic Measurement:**
    *   The physical parameters of the target site are measured using modern geospatial tools (e.g., Google Earth Pro).
    *   This establishes the key fixed variables: the precise coordinates of the observer and the target, the elevation difference, and the **Geographic Azimuth** (the compass direction from the observer to the target).

2.  **Astronomical Modeling:**
    *   A Python script utilizes the **`astropy`** library to calculate the precise position of the sun for any given historical date and location.
    *   The model calculates the **Astronomical Azimuth** of the sun at the moment it visually aligns with the target feature on the horizon (e.g., the center of the mountain pass).

3.  **Verification:**
    *   The final step is a direct comparison between the fixed Geographic Azimuth of the landscape and the calculated Astronomical Azimuth of the celestial event. A close match across significant historical eras provides strong, quantifiable evidence of a functional alignment.

## Case Study: The Shechem Pass (Mount Gerizim & Ebal)

As a primary proof-of-concept, this methodology was applied to the pass between Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal in the Southern Levant, a site of immense historical significance.

*   **Hypothesis:** The pass functions as a natural gateway for a major solar event.
*   **Event:** The sunrise on the Winter Solstice.
*   **Result:** The analysis confirms a historically stable and remarkably precise alignment. The calculated difference between the pass's geographic center and the sun's azimuth on the Winter Solstice for key historical dates is minimal, confirming that this would have been a consistent and easily observable sacred event for ancient peoples.
